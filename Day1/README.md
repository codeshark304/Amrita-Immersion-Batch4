# Day 1 â€“ Product Failure Analysis, Gap Analysis & Capstone Planning

Welcome to the Day 1 folder of our internship journey. This folder contains the outputs of three key tasks conducted on the first day, focusing on real-world product analysis, innovation gap analysis, and the foundation for a capstone project.

##  Task 1: Product Failure Analysis

*Topic:* Construction Site Elevator Failure Modes

We analyzed real-life failure points in construction elevators, emphasizing the safety, design, mechanical, and control system issues that could lead to malfunction or hazard. This task included:

- Identifying major failure types
- Analyzing root causes
- Suggesting preventive measures



##  Task 2: Product Gap Analysis

*Topic:* Apple iPhone â€“ Gap Identification

In this task, we evaluated the Apple iPhone product line to identify potential innovation gaps and unmet user needs. We used Lucidchart to map out existing product offerings, limitations, and areas where enhancements could bring user or market value.

##  Task 3: Capstone Project 

*Proposed Capstone:* Safety Monitoring for Hazardous Goods Warehouses

We brainstormed and outlined a project idea focusing on real-time safety monitoring in warehouses storing hazardous materials. The proposal outlines:

- Use of sensors for fire, gas, motion detection
- IoT dashboard and alerts
- Safety protocols and incident logging
